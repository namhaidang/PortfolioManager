Okay, please read back your changes and do an ultra detailed review. Do not dump back any code in this review, only concise and clear explanations/summarizations. Look for bugs or things that are incomplete or incorrect and need to be polished. Give me a 0-100 grade for the quality of the implementation overall. And if there are any issues, please give a very concise list with a detailed description of each one and your suggestions for how to resolve, ordered from most critical to least, with a score from 10 - 0 of how important it is to address, 10 is most important, 0 is least.
