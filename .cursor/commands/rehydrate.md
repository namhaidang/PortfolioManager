Context may have been manually compacted/summarized. Let's do a fast “rehydration” pass to rebuild full implementation readiness into your current context window.

Be very token efficient. Do NOT re-open broad exploration threads. Prefer crisp bullets over prose. The goal is to make your context window perfectly ready for implementation with full visibility into the things you're about to edit and the key files, without overdoing it and using up too much context window space - and then make sure you're back at the same confidence as we were at before on the plan. 

No code changes or implementation yet, just confirm readiness after you're finished the above and your new confidence score 0-100 on implementing cleanly, concisely, and elegantly given your newly refreshed context window.
