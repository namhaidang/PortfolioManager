Okay, let's do a pre-flight check before implementing this. 

Please read in directly affected files as well as key related or adjacent files so that you can have a full view in your context window, but be judicious and very token efficient so that we save context window room for implementation time.

Provide an initial 0-100 confidence score on whether you can implement this cleanly, concisely, and elegantly.

Then, if your confidence score is < 97%, do some thinking, reflection, research, and/or ask me questions about any unclear or underspecified key areas as needed to bring your confidence score up to that level.
