Step 1. Please go ahead and implement cleanly, concisely, and elegantly.

Step 2. Run a lint:fix and type-check and clean up any identified issues.

Step 3. Detailed review your work with a clean/fresh eye. Do not dump back any code in this review, only concise and clear explanations/summarizations. Look for bugs or things that are incomplete or incorrect and need to be polished. Give me a 0-100 grade for the quality of the implementation overall. And if there are any issues, please give a very concise list with a detailed description of each one and your suggestions for how to resolve, ordered from most critical to least, with a score from 10 - 0 of how important it is to address, 10 is most important, 0 is least. Output this to the chat before continuing automatically to the next step so we have a record of where things stand.

Step 4. If there are clear bugs or issues that are unambiguous to solve or clean up, and that leave the codebase in a better state (i.e. more robust, more performant, clearer and more concise, NOT overly defensive or bloated), then please proceed to do a round of polishing and fixing of just those items and then go back to step 2.  If there are other issues that could be solved in different ways that have an impact on the design of the codebase or key tradeoffs, do not automatically fix those and instead keep those in mind.

Step 5. At this point, you've already done rounds of initial cleanup and what remains are the issues requiring input.  Describe what's left clearly as in step 2 and wait for input and guidance on which way to go. Ask good, concise, and clear questions for each item to help guide the user to easily answer everything in one pass.

Step 6. Based on the user's input, generate a clean, concise, and elegant plan for the remaining changes and fixes. Give a confidence score 0-100 on impementing them.  Then wait for the user to review and provide input.
