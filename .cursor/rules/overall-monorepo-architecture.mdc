This project is a monorepo with projects in apps/ and packages/.  It's primarily all node.js code so we use Turborepo.

The primary frontend app is a Next.js project under apps/frontend.

The primary backend app is an express project under apps/api.

The details are specified in the ARCHITECTURE.md file in the root, so you can pull it if you need to use that context to make effect changes or find things.
