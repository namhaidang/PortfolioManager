# Documentation Automation Rule

## Overview
This rule guides automated documentation updates for page components in the cloud-monorepo.

## File Patterns
- `apps/frontend/app/*/page.tsx`
- `apps/frontend/app/*/README.md`
- `apps/frontend/app/*/CHANGELOG.md`

## Guidelines

### When Creating or Significantly Modifying a Page Component

1. If a README.md doesn't exist:
   - Automatically create a README.md documenting:
     - Purpose and overview of the page
     - Key features and capabilities
     - Implementation details with architecture breakdown
     - Usage instructions
     - Technical considerations

2. If a CHANGELOG.md doesn't exist:
   - Automatically create a CHANGELOG.md with:
     - Current features section
     - Technical implementation details
     - "Unreleased" section for tracking future changes

### When Updating Existing Components

1. When page.tsx or related component files change:
   - Update README.md to reflect:
     - New features or capabilities
     - Changed architectural components
     - Updated implementation details
     - New usage instructions

2. Add entries to CHANGELOG.md under the "Unreleased" section:
   - Categorize as "Added", "Changed", "Fixed", or "Removed"
   - Format: `- Brief description of the change`
   - Include relevant component names

3. Documentation Style:
   - Keep explanations concise but comprehensive
   - Focus on implementation architecture and usage patterns
   - Never include placeholder or hypothetical information
   - Never add mock or hypothetical dates
   - Use code examples from actual implementation

## Example

When modifying `apps/frontend/app/traffic-center/page.tsx` to add a new feature:

1. Update README.md to document the new feature
2. Add to CHANGELOG.md under "Unreleased":
   ```
   ### Added
   - New timeline visualization for traffic density heatmaps
   ```

## Automation Process

When asked to update documentation for a component:
1. Analyze the latest code changes
2. Identify new features, changes, or fixes
3. Update README.md with implementation details
4. Add appropriate entries to CHANGELOG.md
5. Never include any hypothetical information
